## Biography]
Hi! I'm Eric, and I'm from Diamond Bar, a small city in Southern California. I am currently going into my second year of classes at University of California, Berkeley, where I am studying Computer Science. Here you will find all the information about my journey into the software engineering world!

## Classes 
These are the classes I have taken so far in my time at UC Berkeley. If you would like to learn more about each class, just click the link and it will take you to the class website!

1. Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs ([CS 61A](http://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs61a/fa17/)) 
2. Data Structures and Algorithms ([CS 61B](https://sp18.datastructur.es/))
3. Discrete Mathematics and Probability Theory ([CS 70](http://www.eecs70.org/))
4. Linear Algebra and Differential Equations ([MATH 54](https://math.berkeley.edu/courses/choosing/lowerdivcourses/math54)) 
5. Foundations of Data Science ([DATA 8](http://data8.org/fa18/))
6. Designing Information Devices and Systems II ([EE 16B](https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~ee16b/sp18/))

## Experience
### Academic Intern
I'm currently part of the course staff in official UC Berkeley computer science classes, CS61A and CS61B. After learning so much in both classes, I wanted to help assist labs, monitor office hours, and mentor students as an academic intern. Plus, I get to earn upper division units!

## Projects

## Organizations
### Computer Science Undergraduate Association
I joined the Computer Science Undergraduate Association to meet and work with fellow CS majors at UC Berkeley. With over 1000 members in this organization, I have expanded my knowledge of the CS world and became part of such a huge CS community!
